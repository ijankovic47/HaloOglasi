# HaloOglasi

This is my final work at academy. It is Maven WEB application using Spring and Hibernate frameworks. In a project folder there is a 
database ERR diagram for better understandig and one sql script that needs to be imported for the application to work fine (edit dataSource bean in application context file). It is an application for advertisement. I was not focusing on application's front-end due to lack of time, the focus was on object-relational mapping.
